This repository contains the code used for data analysis. Containing the following files:

 -  `quantify_function.R` and `quantify_script.R` for semi quantification in suspect screening applications
 - `clusteranalysis_kml.Rmd` for temporal cluster analysis example
 - `cluster_predicition` calulating the distances of new feature to already prioritized trends.
